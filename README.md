# Thaumcraft 7

## Preface

An attempt to rewrite azanor's Thaumcraft for modern versions of Minecraft. 
I am in no way associated with azanor and will not use any of their assets, 
except perhaps the mod name.

What version of Thaumcraft am I copying? None specifically. The plan is to 
keep the best features from each version, using Thaumcraft 4.2 as the skeleton
(because I enjoyed it the most). I may add small features that did not exist 
in the original mod, always staying faithful to the original experience.

I happen to be Greek, Thaumaturgy literally means "the act of performing miracles".
Good pick azanor ;-)
